      <p class="tribute-info">
        This page came into being initially through <a id="fcc-link-inpage" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a>. I'm working through their Responsive Web Design curriculum, and this is the first of the five final projects.</p>

      <p class="tribute-info"> Despite it being FreeCodeCamp that set me on this task, the topic itself is purely from my love of the actor.</p>

      <p class="tribute-info">Robin Williams, what can we say? He was an outstanding actor, a hilarious comedian and a towering inspiration to reach for the stars.<br>
        <br> Let's celebrate some of his best loved movies and characters, as well as revisit some of his most touching quotes.</p>

      <p class="tribute-info">This is the life of Robin Williams. If you know who he was and loved his work - enjoy, and shed a smiley tear. If you don't know who he was... welcome, let's introduce you the right way!</p>
