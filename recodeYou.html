<!-- This page will eventually be my proper portfolio page.  For now, it's going to be a combination of a playground, a random thought catcher <br> 
and generally just somewhere for me to play around.  
Hopefully this is eventually going to have some of my projects displayed, decent design and all self built UI, blog, etc.
