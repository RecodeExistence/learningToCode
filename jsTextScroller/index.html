	<h1> JavaScript Terminal Entry </h1>
	<p> I wanted to create a little logo that had a text line being entered as though on an old DOS terminal.  
	I have zero graphic skills currently, so I thought I might try making it in JavaScript.  This is my result.</p>

	<form> 
	<input id ="text-box" type = "text-box" value="Here is a text box">
	</form>
