	Continue branch "starting_model"

	Moved ships array of objects containing location and hits in each array index as it's own object.  key:value pair = ships:data structure.  

	Completed fire() method.  Checks for indexOf user guess.  Returns true if contained in location object array.  False otherwise.  

	created isSunk() method, checks through the hits array to see if all 3 locations of a ship are hit yet.  
		called in the fire() method each time a guess is passed from the controller.  

	Added the code to update the view that state has changed and it needs to react accordingly.  
		Tested model by calling fire on hardcoded values.
